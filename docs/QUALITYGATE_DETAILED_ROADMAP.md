# QualityGate — Plugin-First Engineering Quality Platform

**Origin:** https://github.com/nikolai-tatianenko/lighthouse-nodejs-cicd  
**Vision:** Define quality policies once; run existing tools through plugins; give developers, AI agents, and CI/CD the same deterministic decision and evidence.

## Principles

- Microkernel: registry, lifecycle, dependency resolution, events, authorization, orchestration.
- Every concrete gate, transport, reporter, storage backend, and integration is a plugin.
- Keep deterministic policy enforcement trusted; plugins cannot override a final BLOCK.
- Versioned TypeScript SDK and Zod schemas; no hardcoded Lighthouse/MCP dependencies in core.
- Separate execution status from policy decision. Missing required checks never count as PASS.
- Local-first, no account required. Plugin permissions must be enforced by execution boundaries, not just declared in manifests.
- React Ink for terminal; React + shadcn/ui + design tokens for web/Tauri; Chrome extension uses shared protocol/client, not shell access.

Create packages incrementally rather than scaffolding all at once.

## How to execute this plan

Each task is independently trackable as a GitHub issue. Work in small PRs (ideally 1–3 tasks), with a failing test or reproducible example before implementation. A task is complete only when its acceptance criteria are demonstrated, tests pass, and docs/examples reflect the behavior.

**Task labels:** `P0` foundation and release-critical; `P1` platform expansion; `P2` ecosystem. **Estimates** are directional only; no commitment. **Ownership:** one engineer by default. **Blocked** tasks should not be started before their dependencies are satisfied.

**Non-negotiable rules:** core imports no concrete gate or transport; CLI/MCP/UI consume the same run model; missing required evidence never passes; plugin manifests do not constitute isolation; browser/desktop plugins cannot gain shell access through a UI bridge; no destructive rename before a working beta.

## Milestones and dependency gates

| Milestone | Phases | Release gate |
|---|---|---|
| M0 — Repo foundation | 0 | Fresh clone, build, lint and smoke test work |
| M1 — Extensible engine | 1–2 | External fixture plugin loads; deterministic decisions |
| M2 — Usable CLI | 3–4 | Lighthouse + ESLint + Vitest through Ink CLI |
| M3 — Agent-ready | 5 | MCP and CLI return identical evidence for same run |
| M4 — Public beta | 6–7 | Web dashboard, CI integration, docs, public release |
| M5 — Desktop/browser | 8–9 | Secure pairing and shared run IDs |
| M6 — Stable ecosystem | 10 | Versioned SDK, plugin isolation strategy, compatibility suite |

## Cross-cutting engineering standards

- **Test pyramid:** unit tests for pure schemas/policies; integration tests for plugin lifecycle and subprocess behavior; E2E tests for CLI, MCP and dashboard. Add golden fixtures for normalized reports.
- **Schema compatibility:** include `schemaVersion` on serialized records; maintain forward-compatible optional fields and migration tests.
- **Security:** v0.1 trusts explicitly installed local plugins. Do not advertise sandboxing until isolation is implemented and tested. Commands are configured locally; MCP input cannot substitute executables or escape workspace.
- **Observability:** every event includes runId, gateId where applicable, timestamp, severity and sequence; logs are bounded and secrets redacted.
- **Reliability:** atomic report writes, deterministic aggregation, explicit cancelled/skipped/errored states and cleanup after interruption.
- **DX:** quickstart must work on a fresh checkout; `--json` is stable and machine-readable; interactive Ink output is disabled in CI.
- **Design system:** web and Tauri share React components; Ink shares tokens/protocol, not DOM components; Chrome extension shares protocol/client but minimal UI.
- **Documentation:** ADR for significant trade-offs, examples for public contracts, changelog for breaking changes.

## Example end-to-end acceptance scenario

1. Clone the repository, install dependencies, and start the fixture web application.
2. Run `qualitygate init` to generate a valid config with Lighthouse, ESLint and Vitest.
3. Run `qualitygate run` and inspect a single run ID with typed gate results and artifacts.
4. Introduce a lint error; rerun; confirm `BLOCK`, nonzero exit code and the offending file/line.
5. Invoke the same run through MCP; confirm policy decision and evidence are identical.
6. Open the web dashboard; inspect the real run and its findings.
7. Add a third-party fixture gate without modifying the microkernel.
8. Confirm unapproved commands and out-of-workspace paths are rejected.

## Scope controls

**Must ship for v0.1:** Phase 0–7, with a minimal web dashboard and no hosted service.  
**Explicitly defer:** Tauri, Chrome Extension, marketplace, remote execution, visual baseline approval, plugin sandbox claims, multi-user authentication.

**Definition of public beta:** A new developer can install, configure and run real checks in under ten minutes; the tool blocks a deliberately broken project; an AI client can inspect structured evidence; an independent plugin can be added through the SDK.
